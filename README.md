# AI_course
My solutions to the programming exercises within the CS50 AI course (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/).
The course is 7 weeks long and for each week I have to do a small and large programming exercise, which I upload here
as soon as I have finished them. Within the folders of the different weeks I have written another README, in which I 
specify how to run the code and which functions I have written in the different files.
