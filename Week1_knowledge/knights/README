AI technique used:
Knowledge base

Background from website:
In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will 
always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave 
states a sentence, then that sentence is false.
The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether 
that character is a knight or a knave.
