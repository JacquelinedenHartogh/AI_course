AI technique used:
Neural networks

Background from website:
As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, 
allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this 
involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and 
more. In this project, you’ll use TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image 
of those signs. To do so, you’ll need a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized 
by the road sign represented in them. Several such data sets exist, but for this project, we’ll use the German 
Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of 
road signs.

Work done:
In traffic.py I implemented the functions: load_data and get_model.

Run via:
python3 traffic.py gtsrb
Before then:
Download the data set for this project (https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) and unzip it. 
Move the resulting gtsrb directory inside of your traffic directory. Inside of the traffic directory, run 
"pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to install this project’s dependencies: opencv-python for image processing, 
scikit-learn for ML-related functions, and tensorflow for neural networks.
