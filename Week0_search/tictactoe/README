AI technique used:
Minimax and alpha-beta pruning

Background from website:
Using Minimax, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

Work done:
I wrote within tictactoe.py the functions: player, actions, result, winner, terminal, utility, and minimax.

Run via:
python3 runner.py 
But first install pygame via "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
