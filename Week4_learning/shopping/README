AI technique used:
Supervised classification: k-neighbours

Background from website:
When users are shopping online, not all will end up purchasing something. Most visitors to an online 
shopping website, in fact, likely don’t end up going through with a purchase during that web browsing 
session. It might be useful, though, for a shopping website to be able to predict whether a user intends 
to make a purchase or not: perhaps displaying different content to the user, like showing the user a 
discount offer if the website believes the user isn’t planning to complete the purchase. How could a 
website determine a user’s purchasing intent?
Your task in this problem is to build a nearest-neighbor classifier to solve this problem. Given 
information about a user — how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, 
what web browser they’re using, etc. — your classifier will predict whether or not the user will 
make a purchase. Your classifier won’t be perfectly accurate — perfectly modeling human behavior 
is a task well beyond the scope of this class — but it should be better than guessing randomly. 

Work done:
In shopping.py I implemented the functions: load_data, train_model, and evaluate.
